# Email-classification-problem-with-MLPs-and-RNNs
In this project, I employed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to address an email classification problem. To be more specific, I conducted an in-depth implementation of Deep Learning techniques, including activation functions, embeddings, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The results were assessed using various metrics and visualized through charts using Python with the Keras library.
